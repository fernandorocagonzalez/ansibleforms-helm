# Changelog

## 6.2.0

First release with continuous integration and an automated publish. Nothing was
renamed and no value was removed, so an existing release upgrades in place.

### Fixed

- **The server could not bind its port on a stock cluster.** It listens on 80 or
  443, both privileged, as an unprivileged user, and a pod network namespace
  always starts with `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start` at 1024 regardless of
  the node setting. The process died with
  `listen EACCES: permission denied 0.0.0.0:80` and the pod never came up. It
  happened to work wherever something else had already lowered that sysctl,
  which is why it went unnoticed. The chart now sets the sysctl itself, which is
  on the kubelet's safe list; `containers.server.bindPrivilegedPorts: false`
  turns it off. Note that adding `NET_BIND_SERVICE` does not fix this: the
  process is already non-root at exec, so the capability never reaches its
  effective set.
- `HTTPS: 1` no longer breaks the render. The value is documented as `0`/`1` and
  people write it unquoted, which YAML reads as a number, while the template ran
  it through `atoi`, which only accepts strings. Only the quoted `"1"` used to
  work.
- `services.server.type: LoadBalancer` no longer breaks the render when no fixed
  address is given, which is the normal case with MetalLB or a cloud controller.
  The template dereferenced `loadbalancer.ip` without checking the parent key
  existed.
- `containers.server.strategy` accepts the Kubernetes shape (`{type: Recreate}`)
  as well as a plain string. The map form used to render as
  `type: map[type:Recreate]`, which the API server rejects.
- `templates/mysql-pv-claim.yaml` held two half-merged copies of the same PVC in
  one document. YAML kept the last of each duplicated key, so the file happened
  to produce a valid claim, but the first copy was dead weight and the mistake
  was invisible.
- Removed `templates/namespace.yaml`, which was an empty file.
- The README examples used `application`, `storage`, `service` and `container`
  where the chart expects `applications`, `storages`, `services` and
  `containers`. Copying an example configured nothing and silently left the
  placeholder defaults in place.

### Changed

- Added a `startupProbe`, enabled by default with a 300 second budget. On a
  fresh install the database migrations can outlast the liveness probe, and the
  kubelet then restarts a pod that was making perfectly good progress. Tune it
  under `containers.server.startup`, or set `enabled: false` to drop it.
- `stdin` and `tty` now default to `false`. A server process has no use for a
  terminal.
- The default MySQL image is pinned to `mysql:8.4` instead of `mysql:latest`. A
  floating tag means an unattended major upgrade whenever the pod is
  rescheduled, and MySQL does not support downgrades, so a rollback leaves the
  data directory unreadable. **Already running a 9.x image? Set
  `containers.mysql.image` to your current tag before upgrading this chart.**
- `appVersion` is set for the first time, and the default application image
  moved from `6.1.3-rc` to the released `6.2.1`. Chart version and application
  version are tracked separately from now on.
- Standard `app.kubernetes.io` labels on the server Deployment and both
  Services. Selectors were left untouched, since they are immutable on an
  existing object.

### Added

- `containers.server.podAnnotations`, for a checksum annotation or anything else
  that should trigger a rollout.
- `storages.<component>.accessMode`, still `ReadWriteMany` by default. Plenty of
  storage classes only offer `ReadWriteOnce`, and with a single replica that is
  perfectly fine.
- `failureThreshold` on the liveness and readiness probes.
- CI on every pull request: `yamllint`, `helm lint`, and a render of six value
  scenarios against three Kubernetes versions checked with `kubeconform`, plus a
  real install on kind. All four bugs above were found by writing it.
- Releases are published automatically from `Chart.yaml`, as a GitHub release, an
  OCI artifact on GHCR and a Helm repository on GitHub Pages.
